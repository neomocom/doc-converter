        <title>Effect of stress coping ability and working hours on burnout among residents | BMC Medical Education | Full Text</title>



    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Burnout among residents leads to interruptions in training and even to exit from programs. Despite the implementation of working hour restrictions in the U.S. in 2013, the high rate of burnout remains a serious problem. Therefore, we analyzed Japanese residents&#8217; burnout, training conditions, and associated factors, especially stress coping ability, which could become an evidence base for creating guidelines of programs and working environments. In total, 37 teaching hospitals were randomly selected, and all residents in the third and fifteenth months of a residency program at these hospitals were targeted for this research. We analyzed the residents&#8217; burnout rates, associated factors, and interactions using response data from a self-administered questionnaire consisting of the Japanese versions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, as well as items asking about their training environments, gender, and age. Overall, 48 (49.5%) of 97 residents in 18 teaching hospitals (62 and 35 in the third and fifteenth months, respectively), whose average working hours were 63.3&#8201;h per week, were judged as having burnout, among whom, 33 (53.2%) and 15 (42.9%) had burnout in the third and fifteenth months, respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated that working hours and 10 items on the SOC scale (SOC10) were significant factors of burnout. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that working hours was a significant variable for the MBI-emotional exhaustion score and SOC10 in the third and fifteenth months, respectively. Regarding the MBI-cynicism and professional efficacy scores, the SOC10 was a significant variable in both the third and fifteenth months. In addition, the high SOC group (SOC10&#8201;&gt;&#8201;45) showed higher personal efficacy under longer working hours. About half of the Japanese residents were judged as having burnout as early as the third month of training under regulations of working 40&#8201;h per week. Individual stress coping ability and working hours were found to be significant factors for burnout. Residents with high stress coping ability exhibited more personal efficacy with more working experiences, which suggests that the SOC scale could be a valuable tool to help foster a suitable training environment."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="Effect of stress coping ability and working hours on burnout among residents"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="Background Burnout among residents leads to interruptions in training and even to exit from programs. Despite the implementation of working hour restrictions in the U.S. in 2013, the high rate of burnout remains a serious problem. Therefore, we analyzed Japanese residents’ burnout, training conditions, and associated factors, especially stress coping ability, which could become an evidence base for creating guidelines of programs and working environments. Methods In total, 37 teaching hospitals were randomly selected, and all residents in the third and fifteenth months of a residency program at these hospitals were targeted for this research. We analyzed the residents’ burnout rates, associated factors, and interactions using response data from a self-administered questionnaire consisting of the Japanese versions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, as well as items asking about their training environments, gender, and age. Results Overall, 48 (49.5%) of 97 residents in 18 teaching hospitals (62 and 35 in the third and fifteenth months, respectively), whose average working hours were 63.3 h per week, were judged as having burnout, among whom, 33 (53.2%) and 15 (42.9%) had burnout in the third and fifteenth months, respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated that working hours and 10 items on the SOC scale (SOC10) were significant factors of burnout. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that working hours was a significant variable for the MBI-emotional exhaustion score and SOC10 in the third and fifteenth months, respectively. Regarding the MBI-cynicism and professional efficacy scores, the SOC10 was a significant variable in both the third and fifteenth months. In addition, the high SOC group (SOC10 &gt; 45) showed higher personal efficacy under longer working hours. Conclusion About half of the Japanese residents were judged as having burnout as early as the third month of training under regulations of working 40 h per week. Individual stress coping ability and working hours were found to be significant factors for burnout. Residents with high stress coping ability exhibited more personal efficacy with more working experiences, which suggests that the SOC scale could be a valuable tool to help foster a suitable training environment."/>

Despite the implementation of working hour restrictions in the U.S. in 2013, the high rate of burnout remains a serious problem. Therefore, we analyzed Japanese residents’ burnout, training conditions, and associated factors, especially stress coping ability, which could become an evidence base for creating guidelines of programs and working environments.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>In total, 37 teaching hospitals were randomly selected, and all residents in the third and fifteenth months of a residency program at these hospitals were targeted for this research. We analyzed the residents’ burnout rates, associated factors, and interactions using response data from a self-administered questionnaire consisting of the Japanese versions of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, as well as items asking about their training environments, gender, and age.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Overall, 48 (49.5%) of 97 residents in 18 teaching hospitals (62 and 35 in the third and fifteenth months, respectively), whose average working hours were 63.3 h per week, were judged as having burnout, among whom, 33 (53.2%) and 15 (42.9%) had burnout in the third and fifteenth months, respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated that working hours and 10 items on the SOC scale (SOC10) were significant factors of burnout. Two-way analysis of variance revealed that working hours was a significant variable for the MBI-emotional exhaustion score and SOC10 in the third and fifteenth months, respectively. Regarding the MBI-cynicism and professional efficacy scores, the SOC10 was a significant variable in both the third and fifteenth months. In addition, the high SOC group (SOC10 &gt; 45) showed higher personal efficacy under longer working hours.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusion</h3><p>About half of the Japanese residents were judged as having burnout as early as the third month of training under regulations of working 40 h per week. Individual stress coping ability and working hours were found to be significant factors for burnout. Residents with high stress coping ability exhibited more personal efficacy with more working experiences, which suggests that the SOC scale could be a valuable tool to help foster a suitable training environment.</p></div></div></section>

When these students start residency training in a teaching hospital, there is a substantial change in their professional role as a licensed medical doctor and in their personal life. Encountering a new environment might be a cause of burnout among Japanese residents at the early phase of training, since working hours, one of the environmental factors, was a significant factor of MBI subscale scores at the third month of training.</p><p>Among burned out residents at the fifteenth month, 80% were emotionally exhausted, and 60% were abnormally cynical. At this point, they tended to have low enthusiasm and view things cynically in addition to having low interest in working compared to burned out residents at the third month.</p><p>Cynicism in the later phase of training has previously been reported [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Michels P, Probst J, Godenick M, Palesch Y.

In addition, these residents showed high professional efficacy, regardless of the training phase.

Our data indicate that residents with high stress coping ability can increase their self-efficacy by gaining more clinical experience, as indicated by working hours, thereby obtaining resilience.</p><p>A previous report pointed out that limiting working hours is obviously effective for the prevention of burnout, but there was some discussion that excessive restrictions might hinder professional development [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Hutter MM, Kellogg KC, Ferguson CM, Abbott WM, Warshaw AL.

We found that appropriate working hours for effective training might vary among individuals, and that in addition to supportive programs for residents, personalized programs compatible with his/her stress coping ability and current burnout status would be required.</p><p>Residents are in danger of burnout at the very early phase of training, and the expression of burnout might change as time passes. Screening residents using the SOC scale could help teaching staff and program directors identify residents at high risk of burnout and provide necessary support early for its prevention without excessively limiting clinical experience for those at low risk.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Limitations"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec11-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec11">Limitations</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec11-content"><p>The hospital targeted in the present study was randomly selected from among those throughout the entire country, but the response rate and number of samples for analyses were low. We could not exclude the possibility that burned out residents did not respond to the questionnaire, or that the prevalence of burnout was higher than that identified in our analyses. In addition, we used a cross-sectional survey design with two data collection points. Thus, the relationship between working hours and burnout at a later phase of a training program remains somewhat unclear because long working hours could be a cause of burnout, and also shortened as a result of burnout. To confirm the changes in burnout status during the training period, it will be necessary to follow these individuals in a cohort study.</p><p>Furthermore, this was a survey of residents in a Japanese training program; additional research in other regions and with different training systems is required before our results can be generalized.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conclusions"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec12-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec12">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec12-content"><p>Half of the Japanese residents analyzed in the present study were emotionally restrained and judged as having burnout in the third month of training. As previously reported, working hours and stress coping ability as evaluated by the SOC were both independent influential factors for burnout. In addition, we found that residents with high stress coping ability maintained their interest and enthusiasm for working and obtained professional efficacy under longer working hours, whereas residents with low stress coping ability were liable to experience burnout under the same working conditions. Individual stress coping ability could therefore be valuable information for fostering a suitable training environment.</p></div></div></section>
